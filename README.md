## Faux SSI

This website does not have actual server-side include, but common components are kept in the `/ssi/` directory. Therein contains the human-readable version of the component and a minified version created using [Will Peavy](https://www.willpeavy.com/tools/minifier/). This serves two purposes: it is very easy to see which code is "SSI" and it is lighter.
